## Images 
<img src="home_screen1.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>

This is the home screen where the un/completed tasks are presented.
The bar at the top represents your progress for the day and is dynamic.
From this screen, you have the ability to edit tasks, complete tasks, and add new tasks.


<img src="leaderboard_page1.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>

This is a "leaderboard" page I made for fun.
It allows you to see your rank among others on the platform and sort them by your preference.
It's creation allowed me to work with Firebase more and learn more about NoSQL database structures.
